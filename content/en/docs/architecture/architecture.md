## Architecture Overview

The software architecture of Kmesh consists of the following core components:

| Component       | Description                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Kmesh-daemon    | The daemon responsible for eBPF Orchestration lifecycle management, xDS protocol integration, observability, and other functions |
| eBPF Orchestration | The traffic orchestration implemented with eBPF, including dynamic routing, canary deployments, load balancing |
| Waypoint        | Based on istio's waypoint to adapt to Kmesh protocols, responsible for L7 traffic management |
