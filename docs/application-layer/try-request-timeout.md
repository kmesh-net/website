# Try Request Timeouts

## Preparation

1. Make default namespace managed by Kmesh

2. Deploy bookinfo as sample application

3. Install service granularity waypoint for reviews service

   _The above steps could refer to [Install Waypoint | Kmesh](/docs/application-layer/install_waypoint.md#preparation)_

4. And install waypoint for ratings service

   ```bash
   istioctl x waypoint apply -n default --name ratings-svc-waypoint
   kubectl label service ratings istio.io/use-waypoint=ratings-svc-waypoint
   kubectl annotate gateway ratings-svc-waypoint sidecar.istio.io/proxyImage=ghcr.io/kmesh-net/waypoint:latest
   ```

## Request timeouts

A timeout for HTTP requests can be specified using a timeout field in a route rule. By default, the request timeout is disabled, but in this task you override the `reviews` service timeout to half a second. To see its effect, however, you also introduce an artificial 2 second delay in calls to the `ratings` service.

1. Route requests to v2 of the `reviews` service, i.e., a version that calls the `ratings` service:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
   kind: VirtualService
   metadata:
     name: reviews
   spec:
     hosts:
       - reviews
     http:
     - route:
       - destination:
           host: reviews
           subset: v2
   EOF
   ```

2. Add a 2 second delay to calls to the `ratings` service:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
   kind: VirtualService
   metadata:
     name: ratings
   spec:
     hosts:
     - ratings
     http:
     - fault:
         delay:
           percentage:
             value: 100
           fixedDelay: 2s
       route:
       - destination:
           host: ratings
           subset: v1
   EOF
   ```

3. Open the Bookinfo URL `http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage` in your browser, where `$GATEWAY_URL` is the External IP address of the ingress, as explained in the Bookinfo doc.

   You should see the Bookinfo application working normally (with ratings stars displayed), but there is a 2 second delay whenever you refresh the page.

4. Now add a half second request timeout for calls to the `reviews` service:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
   kind: VirtualService
   metadata:
     name: reviews
   spec:
     hosts:
     - reviews
     http:
     - route:
       - destination:
           host: reviews
           subset: v2
       timeout: 0.5s
   EOF
   ```

5. Refresh the Bookinfo web page. You should now see that it returns in about 1 second, instead of 2, and the reviews are unavailable.

## Understanding what happened

In this task, you used Kmesh to set the request timeout for calls to the `reviews` microservice to half a second. By default the request timeout is disabled. Since the `reviews` service subsequently calls the `ratings` service when handling requests, you used Kmesh to inject a 2 second delay in calls to `ratings` to cause the `reviews` service to take longer than half a second to complete and consequently you could see the timeout in action.

You observed that instead of displaying reviews, the Bookinfo product page (which calls the `reviews` service to populate the page) displayed the message: "Sorry, product reviews are currently unavailable for this book". This was the result of it receiving the timeout error from the `reviews` service.

If you examine the [fault injection task](/docs/application-layer/try-fault-injection.md), you'll find out that the `productpage` microservice also has its own application-level timeout (3 seconds) for calls to the `reviews` microservice. Notice that in this task you used an Kmesh route rule to set the timeout to half a second. Had you instead set the timeout to something greater than 3 seconds (such as 4 seconds) the timeout would have had no effect since the more restrictive of the two takes precedence.

## Cleanup

1. Remove the application routing rules:

   ```bash
   kubectl delete virtualservice reviews
   kubectl delete virtualservice ratings
   ```

2. If you are not planning to explore any follow-on tasks, refer to the [Install Waypoint/Cleanup](/docs/application-layer/install_waypoint.md#cleanup) instructions to shutdown the application.
