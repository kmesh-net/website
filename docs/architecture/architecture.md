## Architecture Overview

The software architecture of Kmesh consists of the following core components:

| Component          | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Kmesh-daemon       | The daemon responsible for eBPF Orchestration lifecycle management, xDS protocol integration, observability, and other functions |
| eBPF Orchestration | The traffic orchestration implemented with eBPF, including dynamic routing, authorization, load balancing                        |
| Waypoint           | Based on istio's waypoint to adapt to Kmesh protocols, responsible for L7 traffic management                                     |
