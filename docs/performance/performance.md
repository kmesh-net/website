## Observability Integrations

Kmesh provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities through integration with industry-standard observability platforms:

- **Prometheus**: Collects and stores metrics for Kmesh performance and operations
- **Grafana**: Visualizes Kmesh metrics through customizable dashboards
- **Jaeger**: Enables distributed tracing to analyze service mesh traffic patterns

These integrations help monitor Kmesh's performance metrics, resource consumption, and traffic patterns in real-time.

## How We Test

### Testing Tools

Kmesh uses two main testing tools:

- **Fortio**: A microservice load testing tool that measures:
  - Latency (TP90, TP99)
  - Throughput (QPS)
- **Dstat**: A system monitoring tool that tracks CPU usage during tests

### Test Method

Test a group of `fortio` performance data by using the number of concurrent connections as a variable parameter, and collect the CPU usage during the test. The [test script](https://github.com/kmesh-net/kmesh/tree/main/test/performance) has been archived.

## Running the Tests

```shell
#Preparing the test environment
[root@perf]# ./fortio_perf.sh
# Generate a CSV table of test results in the directory.
[root@perf]# ll
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 6.1K Nov 5 17:39 fortio_perf_test.csv
```
