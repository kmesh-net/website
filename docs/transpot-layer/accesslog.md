## Enable Kmesh access logging

Kmesh accesslog can be enabled and disabled using kmeshctl.

Please refer to the [Kmeshctl Monitoring Guide](../developer-guide/Kmeshctl-usage/kmeshctl-monitoring.md)


## Detailed TCP Access Logs Generated by Kmesh

Logs are generated by the Kmesh daemon during key stages of a TCP connection's lifecycle:

- If the `connectionMetrics` is enabled, at regular 5-second intervals while the connection is active.

- Upon connection closure
